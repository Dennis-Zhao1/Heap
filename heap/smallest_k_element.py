# Find smallest k elements from an unsorted array of size n

# solution 1:
# sort it and return the first K element!
# O(nlogn)



# 1. what is the relationship between k and n?


# solution 2:
# 1.How to build a min-heap? heapify it O(n)
# 2.keep poping out K elements. O(klog(n))


# solution 3:
# 1.use a max-heap?
# 2. max-heap first K elements 
# 3. compare the others elements to the first K elements, if it is smaller than heap, than update heap

# solution 4:
#
